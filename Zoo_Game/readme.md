This repository contains two versions of a Go/No-go task that was specifically adapted to be child friendly called the Zoo Game or Zoo Task. 
There are identical versions. The only difference is that one version only contains one picture of an orangutan, which is better for younger children (e.g., 4 years and younger).
The other version has three different pictures of the orangutan. 

The behavioral version of this task has been used in previous papers (e.g., Morales et al., 2018; Development & Psychopathology). 

The current version was used adapted for EEG based on McDermott et al. (unpublished) and was further developed by Grammer et al. (2014). The current version is described and used in Morales et al. (under review).
