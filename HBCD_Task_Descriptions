RS:
3 minute silent video. The video for visit 3 is a compilation of different clips taken from Baby Einstein Baby Mozart videos. They display colorful toys and abstract images. The video for Visits 4 and 6 contains alternating 30 second clips of construction videos and marble runs. The transitions between clips cross-dissolve to avoid a harsh transition between scenes.

MMN:
This task consists of 667 trials wherein the participant hears either a ‘ba’ or ‘da’ sound. One sound is a “standard” which is played in 567 trials and the other sound is a “deviant” which is randomly played in 100 trials. Whether the ‘ba’ or  ‘da’ phoneme is the standard sound is randomized across participants. Each sound plays for 200 ms and the interstimulus interval is 600ms in V04/6 or 800ms for V03.

VEP:
In this task the participant watches the screen where an alternating  black and white checkerboard is presented. The checkerboard pattern is then quickly reversed, the white tiles turn black and vice versa. For this task, the participants viewed 120 checkerboards in total with each checkerboard lasting 500ms.

FACE:
This task consists of two blocks, one in which the participant views 50 upright faces and 50 inverted faces and in the second block there are 50 upright faces and 50 abstract objects. The stimuli are presented for 500 ms with a jittered 600-700ms interstimulus interval, but are progressed by the experimenter based on the infant’s attention to the computer screen. Attention getters are triggered by the experimenter as necessary to keep the participant's attention oriented to the screen.
